I first made a dictionary with the cards 2-ACE assigning values to them of 2-14. After this I made a deck by using the class Cards and making the cards multiply by 4 (for the four suits in a deck of cards).  Then I made a new class called Players and had it initiatize itself with the input "What is your name?" and this would be asked the amount of times that the player indicates at the start of the game when prompted "How many players are playing."  Each player is immediately assigned a hand based on a shuffled deck of cards.  I was unable to compare these cards because I could not retrieve numerical values for them as they were part of the class Cards.  This is as far as I have been able to come, after consulting with Manuel and Genc for a while.
